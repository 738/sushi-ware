# "THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE"

As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want
with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff
is worth it, you can buy me a **sushi üç£** in return.

(This license is based on ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42)].
 Thanks a lot, Poul-Henning Kamp ;)

## FAQ

> Is this license GPL compatibe?

I think "yes", but sorry, I am not lawyer.

> Why you make this license? Why sushi üç£?

I was interested in ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE"], but I am 19 years old! (Japanese law dose not accept to drink alcohole üç∫ under 20.) I need a license like "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" for me. At that time, I want to eat sushi üç£, so I decide to make "THE SUSHI-WARE LICENSE".

> At all, what is sushi üç£?

Sushi is a food consisting of cooked vinegared rice (*shari*) combined with other ingredients (*neta*). It is originated in Japan, but now it is known all over the world so that it becomes Emoji üç£. See also [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi).

> It makes a sense, but I like spaghetti üçù... Could I modify this license?

**Of course, okay!** In this license, it comes from ["THE BEER-WARE LICENSE"].

> Thanks! I buy you a sushi üç£ if we meet some day.

Thanks too! I am looking forward to meet you ;)
